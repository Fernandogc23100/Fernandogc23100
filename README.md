I am an undergraduate Software Development Engineering student at the Multidisciplinary Faculty of the West, University of El Salvador. My passion for technology is immense.
    I am interested in software engineering, technology innovation, and creative design.

  🌱 I’m currently learning ...

  Advanced software development

  Web technologies

👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate on open source projects and tech communities.

✔ Ask me about anything related to software development or design, I’m happy to help if it's within my area of learning! 😉<br>

Outside tech, ☕ I love coffee, 🎸 rock music, 🎮 video games, 🖌️ drawing and sketching, and 🏋️‍♂️ exercising.
